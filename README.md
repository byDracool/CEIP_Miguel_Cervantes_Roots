A comprehensive school management system developed for CEIP Miguel de Cervantes, designed to handle the full lifecycle of student and administrative data. The system manages student enrollment, personal and family information, medical records, class and tutor assignments, grades, and external standardized testing. It also includes modules for school-wide financial administration, cafeteria services, regional scholarship management (CAM), and restricted-access staff management tools for the leadership team. This solution centralizes operations and enhances the efficiency of school administration.
